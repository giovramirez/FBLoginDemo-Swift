# FBLoginDemo-Swift
Facebook Login with SDK 4.1 for Swift iOS 9 Xcode 7

For 4.1 Facebook SDK version you don't need "Bridging-Header.h" this problem was resolved.
You directly use FBSDKLoginKit, FBSDKCoreKit imports in swift class using cocoapods.

To open this project use FBLoginDemo.xcworkspace. If you use FBLoginDemo.xcodeproj, app doesn't build.
